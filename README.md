These files are final deliverables for my DNSC-6211 Programming for Analytics Final Project (Fall 2016). The project was to examine the important factors for the 2016 presidential election results via data-driven methodology including sentiment analysis on tweets in Python, regression and decision trees in R, and visualization in R Shiny.
